Chapter 1 : Search

Blood was coughed forth, warm and scarlet red, while the cold winds of the night howled against the shrouded world and all in its path. Trees shivered and swayed, as they whined at the cold that burrowed into their bark. Faint flakes of snow and ice accentuated the cold and fell on slated roofs and those that guarded them. Though, for what strength and defense a holy structure could bear, it was defenseless against the blight that had already burrowed within.
Incomprehensible mumbles filled the halls, and shadows danced on the walls. From those of humble origins who simply served, to those born into silver and gold, conjecture and doubt reigned. Yet, for the congregation that gathered, there was one group among them that seemed different, both for where they stood and the role they played; the physicians.
"Where is Janos?" Tomas asked, throwing his dark eyes and messy hair on the figures he could see with cautious glances. His the thought of so much as a wave.
arms hung from his sides like ropes, tired muscles struggling at
"That's not important," Peter, his fellow physician replied, scratching his fair hair and trying to wipe off the grease and sweat that was endlessly proliferating his face, "We need a plan, before our heads are on pikes."
"We need Janos, where is he?" Tomas asked again.
"He is with the Queen, again." Peter replied with a nervous demeanor; once more wiping his nose and rubbing off the filth on his sleeve. "Keep your voice down, before you get us killed.
And help me think. We need a plan."
"He is with the Queen at a time like this, even though the King is-?" Tomas began to ask, though before he could, he was interrupted by the presence of another who forced a shiver up his spine.
"The King is what?" A man by the name of Istan demanded to know, marching towards the door they loitered before and throwing off the flakes of ice and snow that clung to him. He stood taller than both men, his thick neck stretching from the large, but richly ordained body below. Fine fabrics of rich colors called any eyes that wandered, though it was the opulence that came in the form of gold and silver that kept it. Yet, for all the gold and silver, it could only do so much to keep eyes off his thin mustache and combed over dark hair. "Go on, speak, I haven't got all night!"
"My lord!" The two physicians said, in a panicked unison as they bowed.
"Did I ask you to lick my boots?" Istvan asked with a tumultuous tone. "Answer my question, now. Or so help me, you very well will know what I stepped in when you lick them." The two physicians stole a glance to one another, silently holding a conversation with their wrinkles and eyes. "My lordâ€”"Tomas began, though quickly trailed off and bit the inside of his own cheek.
THE STOLEN CROWN
The King-" Peter added
uncertainty, though he could not finish other than with a faint weak mumble. "The King..."
"I suppose I should go and see for myself!" Istan proclaimed. "You two going to wait out here while the man you're here to see goes unchecked?" He demanded to know, pressing past them. "Get out of my way and get back to work!"
With a hard push that threw open the door, Istan strode into the room. It was a crowded space, the furniture and decorations lost to the mob of nobles that occupied it.
scene, seeming to advance and retreat, much like the waves of the tide. With nods and glares, and a half dozen daggers behind every smile, Istan was quick to distinguish friends from foes.
Though it was the King that called his attention, as it did everyone.
On a bed alone, lay the man they had all been summoned to see, the man whose blood and authority held the Kingdom in place. Yet, at that moment he was all but drained. His skin was pale, drenched by sweat, the hairs from his head clinging to his skin and doing little to hide his sickliness. Drool hugged the pillows, and the indignities of his own body lay apparent by smell lone. His eyes, when opened, held a look of pain that glazed ver all sight in his view, while the panted breaths of his lungs aised his chest in a manner that screamed of what was to come.
In the company of the whispers, Istan took a knee besides e bed, though quickly shuffled over when a wetness pressed ainst him.
"Sorry," Peter said softly, as he returned to his post and inced at a piss bucket. "I spilled some... Something there lier."
Istan scowled ignoring the comment and smell as best as he Id, while turning his attention to the task that lay just out of
d. With a reach, he extended his arm and opened his hand to p the limb of the King he served.
"My King?" he asked softly, though to no audible reply, as the mumbles of a groan were all that left the royal lips. "My King?" Istan asked again much to the same result. With a sigh, he rose and turned to his fellow nobles, though not before ordering the physicians in a manner to gain praise. "The two of you, get back to work."
With quick movements, Tomas and Peter hurried to either side of the bed and began their tasks once again. They brought forth a multitude of objects and dried plants, waving to one another with discreet orders. Though, time and time again they turned their eyes to their books for guidance, each page revealing the harsh reality of a situation they already knew.
"This could not have come at a worse time," Istvan said in anger, as he took his place beside the other nobles. "The Ottomans are on our borders waiting for the moment to push into our territory. If there is no figure of authority to rule, they will take advantage of the weakness. We need a plan, if this gets any worse... When this gets worse."
The room roused itself with the harsh words of what the future could bring, noble men already cutting the kingdom apart with their desires and preparations. All the while, the truth of the scene lay apparent to only the two physicians.
Tomas and Peter watched with wide eyes, as they stared at the King, who had finally fallen still. His gaze was endless, staring out at something none of the living could see. His breaths were still, and the drops of blood that had pooled, were left to run dry. With a glance to one another, they pressed their ears to his chest. There the two of them lingered for a moment, before they silently shared a look of fear, while the mumbles and greed of those in the room were oblivious to the still heart before them all.
With a nod to one another, the physicians slowly shuffled their way to the door. Step after step, they moved in silence. Yet, before they could reach the door, a voice held them in place.
"What?" Istan demanded, as his eyes leaped from his patron to the two physicians and back again.
"He's gone..." Tomas whispered softly. "The King is...
Dead..."
All eyes fell to the tranquil King, a somber silence befalling the room. Like the still surface of a body of water, a calm lay on each guest's face, though below the veiled mask each wore, a turbulence quickly drew to the surface.
"Where is she?" Istvan demanded to know, his voice finally asking what all those besides him thought. "Where is the Queen?"

Chapter 2 : The Beginning

A still tranquility enveloped the room, as the faint crackle of the fire whispered to the smoke. The warmth it exuded soaked into the rich wood furniture, ornate tapestries, and the two living souls occupying the room.
They stood in the embrace of each other's beating heart, listening and feeling each rise and fall of pressure. Their warm breath tickled against each other's soft skin, the clothes between them doing little to stop what act they were committing.
With each moment that passed, the man held his place, his eyes closed, as if waiting for something. The soft red ordained gown that belonged to his companion, was all that kept the sharp features of his face and long loose hair from touching her skin.
Though, before he could discern what he was waiting for, the sound of heavy feet rapidly approached.
With a hard 'thwack' the door swung open with a fury.
"You can't go in there!" A voice that would have otherwise been heavenly said, as she tried to stop the unexpected and uninvited guest.
"Move!" Istan ordered with a bark, his heavy feet carrying him through the threshold.
"I am sorry your Grace," a woman by the name of Helene Kottanner said, hurrying to stop him. The simple yellow gown she wore hugged her thin, yet tall body, while the faint hint of her golden hair fell from her braided locks, obstructing a few of the scattered freckles that kissed her skin and climbed down her thin neck. Her eyes held a gentle color of a calm body of water, as the soft pink of her lips invited a second glance, though not at that moment.
"What the hell is going on?" Istan asked with wide eyes and anger, catching the two in the act they had been entwined in while the King had passed away.
"You should knock," Queen Elizabeth said softly with a tilt of her head. Her unbound red and golden hair fell to her shoulders, as the exposed skin that flowed down her neck to the cusp of her shoulder held a tantalizing purity devoid of a blemish or mark of labor. Her eyes peered at her guest with a calm expression that was made evermore soft by the hazel color they held. Yet, while her soft red lips seemed as delicate as her voice, they held an authority that forced all to attention, if for only a moment.
"And you!" Istan shouted, as he pulled his eyes from his lingering stare of the Queen and threw them onto the physician, Janos. "What the hell do you think you're doing with your head on her chest? And while he, your King, is still warm no less! I should have you in chains for the mere thought of such a thing!" The fingers of both Queen Elizabeth and Janos were quick to reply, as both held their index fingers extended demanding silence; the first on her soft lips, the second suspended in the air.
For the embrace that was shared was no lay in the biblical sense, or any such connection that bound two and made them one.
Rather, one sat in the chair, while the other pressed closely against her, listening for the secrets that were within her.
"Why, you--|" Istan began to protest, though before he could, he was rendered silent by a third finger, that of Helene who moved to stand in his path.
Silence held the air for a moment, as Janos continued his labor. He wiggled his ear, searching for a beat hidden within a beat, until suddenly with a nod and his eyes thrown wide open, he pulled his ear off of the Queen and turned his attention to those in his company.
"It will be a boy," He explained with a calm, yet confident tone. "I am sure of it. The King and you, my Queen, will have a son."
"What the hell were you doing?" Istan demanded to know, storming over to him and swallowing him in his shadow.
"I was checking her heart, as well as that of the King's unborn son," Janos calmly replied.
"Yes," Elizabeth answered. "As I have long suspected. I will give birth to a son."
A loud scoff and a roll of his eyes was all that Istvan did, as he collected the right words on his tongue. "The King is dead." All eyes fell to the Queen for a moment, as words from her company fell precariously close from being spilled from each of their still lips.
"A shame he has passed without knowing that he will have a son," Elizabeth finally said, as she lowered her head and offered a payer. "I can only pray now that God will tell him."
With a loud grunt, Istvan bit his tongue in frustration and held the words that wished to wiggle forth from escape. Though, he did not hold it at bay for long, as he turned his eyes to the physician whom he held authority over. "Where the hell were you? Where were you when the King, our King, was coughing up blood?"
"There was nothing more that could have been done when he was alive," Janos replied. "He was doomed. The forces that were saw it so. Nothing more I could have done than hold his
hand. Therefore, I saw to tend to his memory and tend to his wife and unborn son, as was requested of me."
"Other men would call abandoning him traitorous," Istvan said softly, staring the man down so closely that the smell of his last meal filled the air between them.
Janos held his gaze for a moment, before fanning the smell and warm breath out of his face. "Onions?"
Like a beast, Istan's nostrils flared wide and a low snarl formed in the back of his throat. His knuckles cracked as he fisted them into balls and the muscles on his thick neck tightened. Yet, before he could do anything, he was interrupted, and his bravado sapped.
"If there is nothing else, I would like a moment to collect myself before I see to my husband," Elizabeth said,
from her chair. The gown she wore shifted with her weight, the soft cloth hugging her body and its curves, though the bump that was her pregnancy drew each person's eyes, further accentuated by the cupped embrace.
"This way," Helene said with a gesture towards the door, waving the men out. "Right this way please."
"My Queen," Janos said with a bow, taking his leave.
Istvan however, was far from cordial, as he lingered and watched the other man go.
"My lord," Helene ordered, pulling his attention and making her point with a raised eyebrow and a nod of her head.
With another grumble, Istan turned to leave, mumbling a faint measure of respect. "Queen."
As the two left and made their way down the hall, there was still one who remained with the Queen.
"Is there anything else that you need?" Helene asked.
Elizabeth, was silent, merely staring out beyond the light of her room and into the hallway where the whispers of footsteps were all but gone.
"My Queen?" Helene asked softly as she stepped closer, placing her hand on her arm.
"Is there anything you need?" Helene asked again with a look of concern.
"No, no," Elizabeth replied softly, lingering between her thoughts and the question at hand.
"Then I will leave you for now," Helene said as she pulled away and made her way to the door. Her fingers touched the smooth surface, though before the hinges could begin to whine, they were made still at the request of authority.
"Helene," Elizabeth said.
"Yes, what can I do for you?" Helene asked back from the doorway.
Elisabeth opened her mouth, though no words escaped her lips. With swift movements, she moved to the door and forced it closed. "Since I was born and given my name, I have known this life for twenty-nine years. I know what is coming."
"My Queen?" Helene asked. "Is something wrong?"
"Helene," Elizabeth said with a soft voice. "I have a favor I must ask. I don't need an answer now, but I must ask it."
"Anything," Helene replied with a smile, oblivious to what words would come.
Elizabeth stroked her belly as if she touched her unborn child, though when she turned to Helene, a fire burned in her eyes. "Would you really do anything? Would you risk your life?"
"Would you do anything?" Elizabeth continued, as she stepped closer to her friend. "Even at the risk of your children's lives?"

Chapter 3 : For An Answer

The cold winds blew against the loose folds of a cloak, as the figure that wore it moved with heavy feet around the structures of the village. His pace was a quick one, only ever made slow when the winds tried to rob him of his balance and sap him of his strength. Though for each gust and the howl that accompanied it, he marched on, past the structures and the warmth that slowly left the corpse of the King.
"Damned physician," Istan grumbled to himself, kicking the small pile of snow he came across. Heavy breaths forced the air from his lungs and into the night with a grumble. He bit his nail, standing just beyond the rays of light from one of the structures, before quickly throwing his hand through the air in frustration. "This is a disaster. A God damned disaster. Stuck in this one-horse village with nothing to do other than wait. This is-"
Before another word could be uttered, a voice interrupted him, reaching out beyond the light. "What seems to be the problem, Istan? Can't think of a good plan?" The figure said from the shadows with the whisper of a snake.
Istvan's eyes narrowed, trying to make shape of the source of the voice within the shadow. "Who's there?"
Approaching like the winter's cold, a figure slowly emerged into the light. The silver hilt of a sheathed dagger was the first thing to reveal itself, as the shimmer and gleam of the finely crafted instrument demanded attention. It held the eye, but as the wielder stepped forward and took shape, it lay second to him, though only by nail. His hair was curly, his posture lousy and the slight inclination of crossed eyes seemed to mark his vision.
What features he had were far from pleasant, whether superficial or deep, though they were productive.
"Fodor Gorgein," Istan said with a hiss. "What the hell is your ugly self doing here?"
"What has you so flustered?" His revealed company asked with a laugh that ignored the words just spoken. "You look like you just stepped into something."
"The King is dead," Istan replied in anger, protruding his jaw and grinding his teeth.
"So?" Fodor asked indifferently. "People die all the time.
You never get worked up about it. Well, generally speaking."
"This is different," Istan replied. "This is a King... This is the King."
"We have had Kings before him," Fodor said. "Will have many more after."
"He was a good King," Istvan explained. "He was a man that knew the threat of the Ottomans. He was a man that knew that strength was needed. And he knew to support us."
"We still have a Queen," Fodor replied, though by design striking a nerve. "She already has a daughter. Besides, good might be a stretch."
A roll of Istan's eyes began his reply, as a scoff of frustration left his lips. "Don't give me that. You know why that will not work. No, that will not work. Not at all."
"You're really going to make me ask?" Fodor inquired with a slight laugh. "Come now, we all know what it is you do. You always have a plan. You always have wend, mereme up you sleeves, So, what is it? You're among a friend, my friend.Â»
Yatan helat a long stare at the vel now. "e can

"You sure it was me, it could have been anyone," Rodor said, as he turned his eyes up to the sky,
"It was you, l am sure of it," Istvan replied.
"Indeed, I was," Fodor calmly admitted with an indifleren roll of his shoulders and a smile. "Indeed, I was. Though, I should remind you that you were just one among many."
"A means to an end then?" Istan asked.
"A means to an end," Fodor replied with a nod. "Took out the wealth and authority of many lesser men who were in the way. You, along with a few others simply got pulled along."
"And gained support of the last King..." Istan added.
"Well, now it would be the second to last King. Must be difficult for you falling so far out of favor now, Especially with the Queen, who never much liked you."
"Well, the wealth that was taken was used in part to secure the power to fight the Ottomans," Fodor said, as he leaned against the closest wall and crossed his arms. "That should make you happy, but I think you already knew that. But, as you say, yes, I have some concerns on my mind, especially with the succession.
She never did like me, don't know why."
"Probably because you're as ugly as a shit covered shovel,"
Istvan replied, as he moved to turn his back to his company and stare down the darkened path he had come. "I know you're there.
Come out!" He ordered, as he watched and listened, waiting for a flutter of any shadows within the dark.
"Thought you were being watched?" Fodor asked with a grin.
Istvan slowly turned his attention back to his company with a narrow gaze. "I may be blunt, but I am not stupid. I gave you the chance to put that dagger in my back and reveal what might have been hidden. As well as scare anyone who might have been listening."
"So, then you are satisfied?" Fodor asked. "Able finally to speak your plan?"
"No," Istan answered, a sinister smile stretching his lips. "I will not tell you the details of it now. But I will say that we must gather power and work to steer the Kingdom down the right path.
A path that sees our interests secured."
With those words cast, Istan began to walk away, though like before, Fodor's voice reached out to him from the shadows.
"So, you do have a plan. Good to know. Let me know when you want to tell me."

Chapter 4 : Awakened From Sleep

The morning light shone through the gaps in the wall as if it was an open in timed with listen fe out is enter as
far from wanted on the skin of a man.
With a grunt and a whine, he rolled out of the ever-reaching dawn's light, trying to stay away from its warmth and its simultaneous awakening.
With heavy feet through the hard dirt and melting snow, a stout, tall figure marched his way from beyond the shelter of his home and company, towards the slumbering man's bed. "Hey, Paulus," he said, as he entered the barn hunched over to fit through the door. His brown hair lay combed carefully to the side, as not a speck of dust or dirt made its home on any part of him.
"I need you to get up. I got work that needs doing and not enough time to do it all. You better not still be drunk."
"Just another hourglass, Mathias," Paulus mumbled, pulling the cloak that was his blanket over his brown hair and soft features, with his heavily scarred and branded hand. "Just another few hoursâ€¦"
"Don't make me get the water, not again." Mathlas warned, waving his finger in a stern warning. "You know I will. I've done it before. I'm not going to feel sorry for you, you know. I will get the bucket. You know I will. And you know what will happen in this cold."
A grunt and a whine filled the air for a moment, followed by a plume of warm air leaving Paulus's mouth like a chimney, "At least close the door. It is freezing. I might lose something important, Something the women of this world can't live without."
"It was opened when I got here," Mathias replied with a sigh.
"You're lucky none of the animals suffered."
"I could have caught my death," Paulus said, as he shuffled back and forth and looked for comfort. "Maybe I should just lie down for a little longer. Make sure I'm well enough to go and work."
With another sigh. Mathias ran his hand through his hair struggling to find the right words, "You're still drunk. I'm going to get the bucket. Yeah, I'm going to go and get it."
"You don't have to do that," Paulus replied with an annoyed sigh of his own. "Why do you want to do that? Do more work and for what? So, you can feel good about yourself? So, you can tell your wife that you came and bothered me? Big man."
"You stink," Mathias quickly stated, as he turned and made his way back the way he had come. "You have been laying in the same spot for who knows how long. And don't talk about my wife." His pace was quick, though not quick enough to escape the words that followed and burrowed into him.
"You really are under that woman's thumb." Paulus said bluntly. "Always knew you were weak, but to choose her over me, shows what a man you are. A short one. And I'm not talking about your height."
"You leave my wife out of this," Mathias replied in saturatec anger.
"I'm just saying, you could at least be honest," Paulus said, as he closed his eyes and remained in the trapped heat of his makeshift bed. "Instead of that passive thing that you and every other woman does."
"You really want honesty?" Mathias asked, growing louder with each word. "You want honesty, fine. What type of a man are you who had it all and lost it because of stupidity and greed, and then does nothing but moan and drink, when he's not begging for a handout? What kind of man brags to people about the brand he got on his hand, when those very same people not only put it there, but laugh behind his back? And what kind of man walks to the capital to beg, when he has good limbs to work with? You still drunk now, or just hungover?"
"That's not fair," Paulus replied with a stoic tone. "I also eat.
And what about you? We used to do good work together. Made enough for you to live here, didn't I? Or did you forget that?" A twitch pulled on Mathias's eye as wrinkles gripped him.
"Yeah, you helped me! But I helped you too! I rememberâ€”" he grew silent for a moment as he shook his head and waved his hand before his face. "You know, I have had it with you. Not even related to you and I'm treating you better than I do my own son. My own son!"
"Well, I would feel bad for your boy, but you're not bothering him right now, are you?" Paulus asked back. "He just has to worry about getting your looks, or hers..."
"What was that?" Mathias demanded to know.
"What was what?" Paulus asked back, with an act of ignorance, as he turned his eyes to him. "Did you say something?"
A stillness held the air for a moment as the two men stared each other down, the only sound permeating between, the subtle drip of the fading snow.
"So, are you going to go?" Paulus finally asked, as he pulled his cover over his head. the sleep."
"You know, I have seen lepers work harder than you,"
Mathias replied as he waved his finger. "And that's not even a joke. That's a truth. Even with their faces falling off and dealing with all that shit people give them. Seen them at least get out of bed."
Paulus peeked his head out of his cover with a long silent stare, as if debating to release the words on the tip of his tongue.
"That's no way to talk about your wife."
Mathias grew still and silent, holding the stare with eyes that grew wider with each beat of his heart. "To hell with the bucket, I'm getting my shovel," he finally warned with a hiss, as he turned around and stormed out of his barn.
A grumble and a reassuring sigh left Paulus's lips, as he pulled the makeshift blanket over his face once again. "He's not coming back," he said with a sigh and a faint laugh, as he turned onto his side and closed his eyes. There he remained, his breaths steadily rising and falling. Though, before he could find comfort and peace, one again the sound of footsteps drew near, and his vision was drawn.
With a shovel in his hand, its spade still covered in mud, Mathias returned with a look of rage across his face. He stood a few steps shy of his friend, his fingers coiling tightly while he readied himself.
"You're not going to useâ€”" Paulus began to say with a laugh, though could not finish.
"GET OUT!" Mathias shouted, as he raised the shovel high and rapidly advanced towards him.
The sound of confrontation and turbulence filled the early dawn, as only one phrase by Paulus could be heard through it all.
"Not the face!"

Chapter 5 : Her Decision

Rains battered the window with a tumultuous sting, while as if frightened by it, a lit candle fluttered on its sheltered side. Stone floors echoed softly in the candle's company, as drops of rain found their way onto them through the carried embrace of a cloak. The one who brought them in was slow to advance, while a slight trail of mud and water followed her.
Through the short and narrow hallway she went, her pace gripped by too much labor and too little rest. Step after step followed one another, until there before a dark door, she fell still.
With a slow whine, the door that kept the sheltered flame at bay opened, as she stopped at its threshold.
Like a treasure, the room held something that called her gaze and forced her to linger despite the dark bags that pulled on her tired eyes. There they lay, what she had traveled to see, the very same thing she had traveled to provide for; her children.
With a soft gaze she watched as her two children slept peacefully in the company of each other. They each lay wrapped by love and the warmth of their blankets, as the cold of the night seemed to be a distant dream.
Though, her presence in the structure did not go unnoticed and from the depths of its shelter there came another. With a shadow cast far and wide, a figure that was familiar to the woman in the doorway approached. A trimmed beard and mature hair graced him, as the bushy brows between them lay scattered and disorderly.
"You're back," he said with a soft whisper, wrapping his arms around her and pressing himself close to her. "I heard what happened, Helene. Terrible."
"Yeah," she replied softly, persisting in the embrace. "Back for a little, Johann. Only a little. I think the Queen will want to have me running off somewhere else soon. I think I will have to."
"Is it true?" Johann asked.
"I would think all the world knows," Helene replied with a sigh.
"But is it true?" Johann pressed.
"Not now, Helene replied, as she continued to watch her children. "T'm tired. I just want a moment."
"Sorry," Johann said pulling away. "I will wait for you in the other room. I got some food there. It's cold. Thought you woul have been back earlier, but it's good."
"I will be there in a little," Helene replied.
what happened."
With receding steps, Johann left Helene to the slumberi company of her children. She stood there with her eyes on the as their gentle breaths raised and dropped the blankets that ga them warmth.
"I can't," Helene finally said to herself with a whisper, she slowly and quietly closed the door. "I am sorry my Que but I can't. I cannot risk them."
With slow steps, Helene made her way through her h and eventually reached the sanctuary that lay laden with f drink, a place to sit and some company. The room was si containing a table lacking splinters with a few cups and b and a pair of benches on either side of it. With a sigh she t seat and rested there with her eyes closed for a moment.
"Tired?" Johann asked.
"How were the children?" Helene asked, ignoring the question.
"Fine, they missed you though," Johann replied, moving his limbs and bringing forth some wine and bread for his wife. "You know you made a mess when you came in. Dragged in a bit of mud with you."
"What about the Queen's daughters, Anne and little Elizabeth?" Helene asked, ignoring the stray in topic.
"They are fine," Johann stated. "Do you know what will happen to them? There is already talk. Quite a bit of it."
Helene was silent as she stared out towards a sight that no one other than herself could see. "Talk?" she finally asked with a whisper.
"I overheard some nobles say that they would push for the Queen's children to be married to secure the border and gain better claim on the other kingdoms," Johann explained, seemingly to himself. "They don't think the Queen will be able to maintain her authority without her husband. Would not be so bad if it were not for the Ottomans. They are talking about having her marry someone else. And don't even get me started on the unborn child. Some say if it is a girl, they will see her sent to the Ottomans as some form of tribute. And if it's a boy, well you don't even want to know. But, I don't know, I just don't know. I can't help but think, what are we going to do? I mean, will we have work for much longer? Should we be looking to the nobles?
Maybe we can take care of some of their children instead? We have a few pieces of silver saved, but that won't last us long if we have to leave."
"The Queen will look after us," Helene replied, finally
"Yeah, but how do you know?" Johann asked, as he tore a piece of bread and put it between his teeth. "She doesn't even have a husband, how is she going to take care of herself? Right
noose."
now, the nobles are working to tie a leash around her or worse a noose. "
"She will look after us," Helene echoed, her tone a note higher.
"You say that, but how do you know?" Johann pressed, searching for some measure of comfort. "I mean, she is in no position toâ€”"
"I know what I have to do," Helene suddenly interrupted as she spoke to herself with a tone that silenced her husband. "I know what I have to do."
"What?" Johann asked. "What do you mean?"
"Nothing," Helene replied. "We will be fine, and the Queen will be fine. And before you ask, I know because I will look after her and she will look after me."
A momentary hiatus settled, as the conversation was left in a lull, only the faint sounds of his chewing filled the air. Finally, with a sigh, Helene pressed against the table and rose back onto her tired feet.
"Where are you going?" Johann asked, mouth half full.
"Shouldn't we talk? At least about the funeral? At least about what we're going to do?"
"Bed," Helene stated more than replied. "I am tired."
"But you haven't eaten," Johann said, as she turned away.
"And we haven'tâ€”"
"Just clean up when you're done," Helene whispered as she vanished.
